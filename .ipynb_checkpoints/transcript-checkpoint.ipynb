    "# Why \"Math with Python?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, I am presenting an idea, a hypothesis or even making a statement - Python can lead to a more enriching learning and teaching experience in the classroom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me explain where I am coming from. When I think back about when I was learning to program and learning all other subjects in standards 7-10. I think it's true today as well. Programming and other subjects such as Math, Science are taught in a disconnected fashion. Programming seems to be all about finding the sum of a series or generating fibonacci numbers. Make no mistake, these exercises are what builds up the programming logic. Some students get really excited about being able to do these, but a lot of them don't.  It's a lot like not everyone gets interested in solving puzzles - i don't, i never took to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think I know of a way we could excite more students! Show them how you can write programs to do your homework, or experiment without having to go the science lab or setup elaborate experimental setups. This is my goal for today - in the following slides and notebooks, I will hypothesise on a way of connecting Python programming and other subjects. That will show that programming is a way to get real work done, not something to learn for the sake of it.\n",
